here i created 2 tables,
		one for storing signin details(table name "note.signin")
		another one for storing the notes and images(table name"note.notes")

user must login with their username and password if it is not a existing user means you must signin with mail id.

then you redirect to my notes page(notes.php),here you save your notes with the format of text or images or link and mark down your notes.
